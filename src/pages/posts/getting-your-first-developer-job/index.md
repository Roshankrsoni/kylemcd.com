So you've either completed your Computer Science degree, finished a boot camp, or have been learning about the development world long enough that you want to find your first job. Finding your first job is a big task; you have to prove to people that they can trust that the skills you learned will apply to the job. You can read tons of articles about how to prepare for interviews, whether it be mastering whiteboard problems, dressing the right way, or playing into the culture. But there are a lot of things that can be seen as "home runs" to an interviewer that you might be missing. 

## Play into your strengths

In most interview settings, you are encouraged to flex the skills that you've learned, but most people tend to focus on the breadth of skills outlined by the interviewer rather than the depth of their own knowledge. While making sure you check the breadth of boxes, targeting those skills where your strengths lie will set you apart from the pack. As an interviewer, knowing someone has a real passion in different parts of the stack makes it easy to preemptively decide where you would see them fitting into the team.

While interviewing for my current position, though it wasn't my first job, I used this strategy to not only highlight the skills I'm best at to the interviewer but also to make sure the position I was applying for matched where my passions lie. For example, I am someone that prides myself on working very closely with designers to create beautiful results. So, on my take-home assignment, I made sure to spend most of my time going into detail on layout, micro-animations, and other fine points that would set me apart in that category.

While your strengths may lie differently, make sure that when you get the arena to show them off, you take full advantage of them. Rather this is a take-home assignment, a coding challenge, or even your communication skills, don't be afraid to go above and beyond.

## Highlight non-technical skills

While technical skills are essential to deciding if you are fit for a position, they are not the only deciding factor on if you are the chosen candidate. In my book, non-technical skills can outweigh some technical pitfalls, especially in an entry-level candidate. Showing that you are an excellent communicator, avid learner, mold-able, etc. puts you ahead of candidates who lack those skills. 

Technical skills can be learned over time, but skills like these aren't naturally acquired. These non-technical skills can shine a light on the potential that you have to succeed in the workplace, which if a company is hiring an entry-level candidate, they're looking to maximize potential there.

Just as was stated before, when the opportunity arises to show off the skills you are strongest in, don't shy away. Demonstrating that you can fill gaps that are above what is expected from your position will put you ahead when searching for your first gig.

## Have an informative personal site
When viewing someone's resum√©, the first thing I tend to get excited about is if the candidate has a personal site, and more importantly, how it looks. It's pretty easy to conclude that candidates with creative sites will stand out from the rest, bonus points if the code is available on GitHub. You can use your site to play into your strengths. So from the get-go, the interviewer is already aware of how your strengths differ from others.

How do you make your site creative, though? Here are some great ones I've found, but search around for inspiration.

## Use prior experience

Whatever route you took to get into the position of applying to developer jobs, there are people you met along the way to guide you. This network of people has already demonstrated that they are capable of going out of their way to help you learn more about this complicated world. So, utilize that. These people will more than likely be happy to be a reference, refer you to a job, or whatever else you will need to succeed. 

Don't let this process rest all on your own two shoulders, but rather utilize the connections you have already formed. The development community, the majority of the time, is happy to help people who ask for it, so ask. 

## In conclusion

Though your first position you accept may not be your "dream job" per se, making sure that you have a great place to grow your skills is paramount. If this means taking a lower salary to work at a company that fosters growth, I would recommend doing so. Doing so will pay dividends in the future for you. 

Remember, the people interviewing you are people. So talk to them, use them as a resource. Though they are sitting on the other side of the table, demonstrating that you are not above asking for help will put you ahead. Most importantly, though, do what's right for you.
