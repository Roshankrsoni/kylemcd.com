title: Why Podcasting didn't work for me

Earlier this year you may have listened to the podcast I started called [git reset](https://gitreset.com). I was so excited about starting a podcast after founding [IronMic](https://ironmic.fm), but in retrospect, my expectations weren't realistic.
So let's talk about it...

## How it started

As I do with many things, I hit the ground running when it came to starting my podcast. I set out a goal of recording a new episode each week with a new guest. The first episode was a huge success, everyone loved the format I had laid out for the podcast. For reference, I had a few different segments where I asked the guest some fun questions about topics around programming. It managed to create some fun responses and dialogue which I think turned into a decent podcast episode.

Riding off of this success I recorded 5 episodes. Each episode I improved as a host which resulted in a better episode each week. During recording, I was having a lot of fun talking to and learning about the guest for that week. I was already familiar with each guest, as all of them I sourced from my Twitter followers (thanks again), but speaking with them was a whole new experience.

## Where it went wrong

I'd like to think I'm a creature of habit, but I am not. My best projects ride off of spurts of inspiration that are hard to sustain after the "honeymoon" phase wears off. The honeymoon phase wore off quickly with this one. As I soon discovered, there is a lot more to podcasting than just recording an episode. You have to plan your guests, find time to record, edit the podcast, promote it, come up with engaging questions, and work that all into your schedule. This was tough for me, scheduling guests on very different timezones wasn't the easiest. I even recorded a few times in the wee hours of the morning to make this work. It was clear to me that this wasn't sustainable. 

Being reliant on other's goodwill isn't fun. I felt uncomfortable asking other people to come on the show, and I felt even more uncomfortable putting my life and other projects on hold to meet this release schedule. So, after 5 episodes of being a podcaster, I decided to call it quits.

## So what now?

I'm pivoting. I love creating content that people enjoy. If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/designbykyle) that is pretty clear. But this time around I wants to do it on my own accord. I want to be able to produce content when I want, about what I want, and not have to produce it because I set out some unrealistic goal for myself. But most importantly, I want myself to be the only person that I'm reliant on for this. 

So what does this look like? Are you pivoting to a solo podcast?? No... I'm going to focus on writing, and what you're reading now is the first of it. With writing, I'm able to talk about topics that I wouldn't be able to convey with a podcast. I can write about deeply technical topics, business, viewpoints, or whatever else I want all under the roof of my personal brand. I don't want to niche myself into a corner as I did with git reset. Essentially, I want an outlet I can expand upon my thoughts in a way that I can't fit into a tweet. 

I'm honestly so excited about this new paradigm. I plan to stay consistent with my writing, but not push myself to a point where it's not fun anymore. Hopefully, this new journey will also help me improve as a writer, which is a skill that needs lots of improvement.
